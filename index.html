`Good morning riri. I'm hella fucking late...`,    
`Hi beautiful. I fucking hated the past 2 days...`, 
`Hi princess! Good fucking morning. Just so you know you're fucking adorable when you sleep... One day im jst gonna spawn in your room. Fuck the distance i hate this shit why tf r u so far away. Oh also im terribly sorry for waking you up in the morning i didn't know i was unmuted. the best part about last night was when we both sorta woke up n smiled at each other. Please lock the fuck in today mf is busy my birthday week.. I love you. See you when you wake up baby.`,
`Hi riri. Iâ€™ve been sitting here thinking about how Iâ€™ve been with you lately and honestly I know I mess up a lot. Sometimes I donâ€™t communicate properly, sometimes I let my moods get the better of me and I hate that you end up feeling it from so far away. You deserve someone who shows up better than I do and Iâ€™m trying to get there, even if it doesnâ€™t look like it right now. Please donâ€™t ever think I take you for granted... I donâ€™t. Youâ€™re the best thing in my life and I donâ€™t want to lose that. I love you.`,
`Hey riri. Idk what it was about today but it really hit me how fucking special you are to me. Like I always knew it but today it just smacked me in the face... youâ€™re my favourite person and the only one who actually feels like home. I donâ€™t ever want to lose that. Also, this next part is about your friends and you can read it out to themâ€¦ Iâ€™m honestly so grateful to you guys for being there for her. It makes me breathe easier knowing she's got people around her who make you feel safe and at home when I canâ€™t be there myself. Iâ€™m lowkey jealous but mostly just thankful. I owe you guys big time.
P.S.: I love you baby, and Iâ€™ll keep reminding you of how much you mean to me every chance I get.`,
`Hey baby. I know youâ€™re in pain and I hate that I canâ€™t be there to take care of you right now. Just go have fun at karaoke, sing your lungs out and try to forget the pain for a bit.. you deserve that. Lowkey, I kept wishing you were with me at the engagement today. It felt like something was missing the whole time. I canâ€™t wait for the day I finally get to have you by my side at stuff like this and actually introduce you to my family. Thatâ€™s all I want, honestly. Until then, just know I love you more than anything.`,  
`hey riri. iâ€™ve been thinking about last night and i feel shitty about it. i know i said things i shouldnâ€™t have and i hate that i made you feel off. you donâ€™t deserve that. youâ€™re way too special to me for me to keep messing things up. have fun tonight at d2â€™s, okay? donâ€™t overthink, just enjoy yourself for a bit. iâ€™ll be right here when youâ€™re back. i love you so fucking much, more than i can ever put into words. itâ€™s stupid how much you mean to me.`,
`hey baby. i missed you so much yesterday. birthday didnâ€™t feel the same without you here, but somehow you still made it special from miles away. i donâ€™t know how you do that. the gifts were perfect... especially the lego cars, that one really got me. you always know exactly whatâ€™ll make me smile. i just wish you were here with me, thatâ€™s all that was missing. I love you so fucking much.`,
`hey riri. last night felt weird. we were talking but it didnâ€™t really feel like we were, you know? you just seemed a little distant. i get that weâ€™re both busy and have to study, but i still try to take out as much time as i can just to talk to you. weâ€™re already far apart, and i donâ€™t want to feel that gap getting bigger. after we stopped talking, i kept replaying that video of us together. i donâ€™t even know why... maybe just to feel a little closer to you. i wanna hold you so bad, just for a bit. youâ€™re literally all i think about, even when iâ€™m trying to focus on other stuff. i love you, and i just need you to start talking to me again. iâ€™m not trying to fight, i just donâ€™t want you to hate me. thatâ€™s why i keep trying to fix things and make you talk to me. iâ€™m never gonna give up on you, no matter how rough it gets.`,
`hi riri. i donâ€™t even know how to start this one. today just feels heavy. writing this hits different knowing weâ€™re not together anymore. itâ€™s weird, because youâ€™ve been such a constant part of my days that everything feels a bit off now. i keep catching myself wanting to text you random things like i always did, then remembering that things arenâ€™t the same. i donâ€™t really know what happens next, but i know that what we had meant everything to me. no matter how it ended, i donâ€™t regret a single part of it. you made my life feel louder, warmer, and justâ€¦ better. i still love you, probably more quietly now, but itâ€™s there. maybe itâ€™ll always be. i hope youâ€™re okay, really.`,  
`hi riri. day 2. it still feels weird waking up and not sending you a good morning text. i keep unlocking my phone out of habit and then just staring at it. everything feels too quiet. i donâ€™t even know what iâ€™m supposed to do with all this space that used to be you. i know we said we needed this, and maybe itâ€™s for the best, but it doesnâ€™t make it any easier. i keep thinking about the small things â€” your voice, the way youâ€™d say my name when you were half asleep, all that. i miss it more than i thought i would. iâ€™m trying to keep it together, trying to let you breathe, but i still think about you every few hours. i hope youâ€™re doing okay, even if iâ€™m not the one asking anymore.`,
